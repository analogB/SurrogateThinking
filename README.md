SURROGATE THINKING: A RATIONALE FOR TREATING ANALOGIES AS RATIONAL

People use the range of their knowledge to help make decisions in new situations and to solve novel problems, often drawing from a breadth of domains. 

• A novel situation that requires analogical thinking.

• The recognition that physical processes from a range of domains can be described by a common relational category or schema. 

• Coupling with extended mental devices and aids like diagrams or other cognitive tools. 

• And even basic category recognition that requires near-instantaneous direction of attention toward diagnostic features. 

These all require people to align their target situation with some source knowledge. But what makes these alignments dependable? My thesis is that the motivated use of predictive correspondence can be considered a rational activity with a statistical basis. While not entirely a new idea, a susceptibility to bias in anaolgical reasoning may have prevented correspondence-making from being considered a rational activity. Here, I establish an explicit inference by correspondence paradigm, which I use to reveal patterns in people’s thinking and decision making that can be compared to the behavior of rational models. I also address the potential and propensity for bias in these kind of processes.
